# GLambda Players
 This is an experimental project which aims in porting [Lambda Players](https://github.com/Emana202/Lambda-Players) from Garry's Mod's very limited Nextbot base to a more practical Player Bots. The "G" in the name can mean two things:
 - Glace - Because most of the code the players operate on is a modified versions (or untouched, idk) of the code from [Glace Bots](https://github.com/IcyStarFrost/glace-base-fcs);
 - Garry - Garry. Garry's Mod. Garry's Modification. And so on and on...
 
 Might or might not conflict with Glace Bots if you have both of them installed.
