# GLambda-Players
 This is an experimental project which aims in porting [Lambda Players](https://github.com/Emana202/Lambda-Players) from Garry's Mod's very limited Nextbot base to a more practical Player Bots.
 
 Might or might not conflict with [Glace Bots](https://github.com/IcyStarFrost/glace-base-fcs) if you have both of them installed, since the code is mostly based or borrowed from it.
